Probability that Amy wins in first roll = Probability of getting a 6 = 1/6

Probability that Amy wins = Amy Wins in first roll + (Probability that Amy misses)*(Probability that Brad Misses)*(Probability that Amy wins)

p = 1/6 + 5/6*5/6*p 

p - 25/36*p = 1/6 

11/36*p = 1/6 

p = 1/6*36/11 

p = 6/11
