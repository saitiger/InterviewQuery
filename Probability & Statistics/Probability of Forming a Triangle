Assuming the first point we pick (X) < the second point (Y)

the lengths are X, (Y-X) and (1-Y)

A valid triangle can be formed by three points where the sum of two points > length of third point 

1. X+(Y-X) > 1-Y 
Y>1/2

2. (Y-X)+(1-Y) > X
X<1/2

3. X+(1-Y) > (Y-X)
Y<X+1/2

Using the 3 equations and Y>X. Probability = Area of Triange = 1/2*1/2*1/2 = 1/8

For the case when X>Y 

Area = 1/2*1/2*1/2 = 1/8

Probability of Valid Triangle = 1/8+1/8 = 1/4
